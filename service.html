       <em> <p><b>Our offering includes a comprehensive portfolio of consulting, recruitment and training services to support companies in their data warehouse environments, as well as services to ensure the realisation of ongoing business.</b></p><br></em>
         <em> <br><p><b>We help our customers to uncover and manage the valuable pieces of information, so that the people at every level in the organisation can make decisions based on proven facts, rather than just gut-feel and emotion. We do this by using our extensive experience in the Business and Data fields, supported by leading software, methodologies and tools. We help you to manage, protect and integrate your data to best support your business.</b></p></em>
   <br><em><p><b>Through our sub-brands, we now have the capability to expand in multiple directions, where the leaders are specialists in their own fields.  In our drive to become a global player, we carefully select our partners, like IBM, a global international technology company, Microsoft, and Tableau for data visualisation.  We have an agreement with Alvarez and Marsal, a global professional services company, to be their technology partner for Africa, to implement and support them in their solutions.</b></p></em>
